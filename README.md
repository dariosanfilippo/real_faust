# real_faust
This repository contains a set of functions representing domain-limited versions of all Faust primitives and math functions that can potentially generate INF or NaN values. The goal of the library is to be able to implement DSP networks that, structurally, are free from INF and NaN values, hence rock-solid during real-time performance.
